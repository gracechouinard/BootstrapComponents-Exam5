          <p class="nin-64">The Game Cube was first released in 2001, following the discontinuation of the game console, Nintendo 64. The Game Cube was released in Japan the beginning of September,2001. It was released in North America the middle of November 2001. The next release of it was in all PAL territories in 2002, all very recently released together. The Game Cube was released around the same time as the Xbox and Playstation 2, thus having to compete with the two. This game was also known as the Dolphin. It was made and developed by Nintendo. It was release in Europe early May 2002 and released very soon after in Australia. It lasted from 2002-2007, 5 years competing with 2 other popular gaming consoles. The Game Cube was priced around two hundred dollars if you wanted it brand new, cheaper if it was used. The Game Cube sold almost twenty-two million until worldwide, most of those sold in the Americas, Japan as the runner-up. It had 16 MB of memory storage. It was one of the first consoles with a memory card. The Game Cube console had its very own controller called the Game Cube Controller and other controllers that would work with the game like, the WaveBird and the GBA. This gaming system was a little heavier than the Nintendo 64, weighing in at five pounds 5 ounces. The Game Cube’s best-selling game was Super Smash Bros. The next gaming system to come after the Game Cube is the beginning of the actual Wii brand. </p>
