          <p class="nin-64">The <i>Wii</i> was first released the beginning of November 2006 in North America. It was released shortly after in other regions of the world. It was the first of the <i>Wii</i> consoles and it was the fifth of Nintendo’s home game consoles. The Game Cube, Nintendo 64, Nintendo Entertainment System, all before it. People that helped develop the <i>Wii</i> are, Satoru Iwata, Shigeru Miyamoto, and Genyo Takeda. They worked around the other competing companies like Microsoft making Xbox and another company making PlayStation. To avoid competition with those companies, they came up with a way to target an audience through novel gameplay. Shigeru Miyamoto and Genyo Takeda led the console’s development with the code name Revolution. The <i>Wii</i> controller was actually named the <i>Wii</i> Remote. It was the first wireless controller for the Nintendo Brand. The <i>Wii</i> Controller has motion sensing abilities to sense your movements for the games. It also works like a TV Remote in a way that you can point it at the screen and select what you want. The <i>Wii</i> was the first home gaming console for Nintendo that used wireless internet connection. It had a shop channel called the <i>Wii</i> Shop Channel where you can buy games and play online with other friends. Other models of the Wii were made that were better and cheaper. It had the same design as the other console but it did not have the Game Cube contributions anymore. This lead to reduced focus on computational power and made it cheaper and other gaming consoles</p>
