          <p>The <i>Nintendo Entertainment System</i> was released July 15,1983. It was the first of the Nintendo Systems released outside of Japan. Before that it had another console, originally called the Family Computer, but it was called off because there was a problem with it. That is when they started making a newer and better system. It became very popularly known as “Famicom”. It sold over 60 million units throughout the world. Before, video games were on the decline, but the <i>Nintendo Entertainment System</i> made video games popular again. It is much different from the consoles we know and love today. Even though it has a controller, it must be plugged into the console instead of battery powered. It was the first console to welcome 3rd party developers. Popular games like the Legend of Zelda and Metroid were created on the <i>Nintendo Entertainment system</i>. It wasn’t released in the US until 1985 where is became widely used. The US was transitioned into a home for video games. It had an 8-bit platform that turned into a 16-bit platform that included the 1988 Sega Genesis. It was then succeeded into multiple other platforms, like Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the Virtual Console System. These systems were created by Masayuki Uemura, Hiroshi Yamauchi, and other employees. They made it better than the other systems before and it was much cheaper. My parents each had this system while they were growing up and so did all their friends. It was popular for kids ranging from 5-18 years old.  </p>
