          <p class="nin-64">The <i>Nintendo 64</i> was the successor to the Nintendo Entertainment System. It came out September 29, 1996, in the U.S. It came out June 23,1996 in Japan and March 1, 1997, in Europe and Australia. The <i>Nintendo 64</i> was the last home gaming system to use cartridges for storage until the Nintendo Switch came out in 2017. It lasted from 1996-2002, being discontinued in April of 2002. 32.93 million units were sold worldwide, most of them sold in the Americas. It had a 16-bit sound system and holds 4-64 MB of storage. It had a specific controller known as the <i>Nintendo 64</i> Controller. It was very light, weighing at only 2.42 pounds. The best-selling game that was accompanied with the <i>Nintendo 64</i> was Super Mario 64, which sold over 11 million copies. The development of this gaming console started in 1993, 3 years before it was put out to the public. It was partnered with Silicon Graphics. The development was finished in 1995 but was but off until 1996 to finish the accompanying games with it. Originally charcoal gray, other varieties of colors came out after the originals were produced. The original has under 4 MB and if wanted, there was an Expansion Pak could be bought to expand the MB. This would also improve the quality of the game, so it was a good idea to get it when you get the game! Time magazines named it the Machine of the year as soon as it came out. It remained this way until 2011 when another company announced it as the 9th greatest video game console of all time! This puts it in the top 10. It was discontinued in 2002 only because another game console came out, named Game Cube.  </p>
